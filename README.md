## Overview

Medieval Maze is a 2D dungeon crawler puzzle game where you have to find the button to unlock the dungeon door. Complete with music, sound effects, animations, exception handling, and dynamic field of vision this project was built for a very enjoyable user experience. Players explore the dungeon maze while avoiding traps and monsters and collecting relics and power ups along the way. Players have the option to load previous save files to play saved games. Once the player dies or completes the game, their score is saved to the leaderboard.

Our primary focus in this project was creating a simple and enjoyable game experience while maintaining clean, well documented code. We utilized our class diagram to plan out the project implementation and kept it up-to-date as the project evolved. We also learned a lot from utilizing github for our version control as we collaborated and implemented features simultaneously, resolving merge conflicts along the way.

## Built With :computer:
